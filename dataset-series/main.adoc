Let's play with dcat:DatasetSeries! 

*Use case*: 
[upperalpha]
. Assuming that we have the following three instances of dcat:Dataset, already published by three different Agents:
[lowerroman]
.. `<beesBE2022>` dereferenced to the Turtle representation at https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesBE2022.ttl[], which is an instance of dcat:Dataset describing an open dataset, published by `Agent1`.
.. `<beesCZ2022>` dereferenced to the Turtle representation at https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesCZ2022.ttl[], which is an instance of dcat:Dataset describing an open dataset, published by `Agent2`.
.. `<beesNO2022>` dereferenced to the Turtle representation at https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesNO2022.ttl[], which is an instance of dcat:Dataset describing an open dataset, published by `Agent3`.

. Assuming further that we have the following file to be harvested into a certain data portal, created by `Agent4` who wants to create and publish an open dataset series by reusing the abovementioned three already published dataset descriptions: 
[lowerroman]
.. https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/source-for-harvesting.ttl[]
.. _Note_: `Agent4` has no mandate neither to update the abovementioned three instances of dcat:Dataset nor to enforce the other agents to do so. The abovementioned instances of dcat:Dataset will thus remain as they are. 

*Possible implementations*: After the harvesting, should this instance of dcat:DatasetSeries, `<beesEU2022>`, 

. use dcat:seriesMembers to refer to the abovementioned three instances of dcat:Dataset, as in https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesEU2022withMembers.ttl[]?
.. Since the dereferenced representations of the three instances of dcat:Dataset do not use the main property dcat:inSeries, this implementation uses only the inverse property dcat:seriesMember. Is this implementation compliant with the current version of https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#inverse-properties[W3C/DCAT3 &#x29C9;, window="_blank", role="ext-link"] (Working Draft per 07 March 2023)? The answer is no, it isn't. 
. or, not use dcat:seriesMembers, as in https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesEU2022withoutMembers.ttl[]?
.. Neither this instance of dcat:DatasetSeries nor the three instances of dcat:Dataset say anything at all about the memberships of this dataset series, how can the (re)users and applications know which datasets are in this dataset series? The answer is no, they can't.
. or, use dcat:seriesMembers referring to new instances of dcat:Dataset which refer to the abovementioned instances of dcat:Dataset using owl:sameAs, as in https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/source-for-harvesting-alt2.ttl[]. 
.. This implementation is compliant with the current version of W3C/DCAT3, and also makes the it possible for our (re)users and non-reasoning applications to know the members of this new dataset series. 
 
*Question*: Nevertheless, wWouldn't it be better if W3C/DCAT3 used dcat:seriesMember as the main property and dcat:inSeries the inverse (instead of the opposite way in the current version, Working Draft per 07 March 2023)?
