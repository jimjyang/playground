Let's play with dcat:DatasetSeries! 

We have the following three instances of dcat:Dataset, maintained by three different Agents: 

* https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesCZ2022[]: an instance of dcat:Dataset, maintained ny `Agent1`,
* https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesNL2022[]: an instance of dcat:Dataset, maintained by `Agent2`, 
* https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesNO2022[]: an instance of dcat:Dataset, maintained by `Agent3`.

We have the following file to be harvested into a certain data portal, created by `Agent4` who wants to create a dataset series using the abovementioned three open datasets: 

* https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/source-for-harvesting[]

*Question*: After the harvesting, should the instance of dcat:DatasetSeries be

. like https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesEU2022withMembers[]: an instance of dcat:DatasetSeries using dcat:seriesMembers referring to the abovementioned three instances of dcat:Dataset
.. Knowing that `Agent4` has no mandate to update the abovementioned three instances of dcat:Dataset, they will remain as they are. Without updating those instances of dcat:Dataset, is this implementation compliant with w3C/DCAT (when it uses only dcat:seriesMember without at the same using dcat:inSeries)?
. or like https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesEU2022withoutMembers[]: an instance of dcat:DatasetSeries _without_ using dcat:seriesMembers. 
.. Neither this instance of dcat:DatasetSeries nor the three instances of dcat:Dataset say anything about memberships of this new dataset series, how to know which datasets are in this dataset series?
