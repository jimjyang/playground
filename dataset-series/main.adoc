Let's play with dcat:DatasetSeries! 

*Use case*: 
[upperalpha]
. We have the following three instances of dcat:Dataset, already published by three different Agents: 
[lowerroman]
.. https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesCZ2022.ttl[https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesCZ2022 (in RDF Turtle)], which is an instance of dcat:Dataset describing an open dataset, published by `Agent1`.
.. https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesNL2022.ttl[https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesNL2022 (in RDF Turtle)], which is an instance of dcat:Dataset describing an open dataset, published by `Agent2`.
.. https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesNO2022.ttl[https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesNO2022 (in RDF Turtle)], which is an instance of dcat:Dataset describing an open dataset, published by `Agent3`.

. We have the following file to be harvested into a certain data portal, created by `Agent4` who wants to create and publish an open dataset series by reusing the abovementioned three already published dataset descriptions: 
[lowerroman]
.. https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/source-for-harvesting.ttl[https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/source-for-harvesting (in RDF Turtle)]

*Questions*: After the harvesting, should this instance of dcat:DatasetSeries, `<beesEU2022>`, be 

. dereferenced to https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesEU2022withMembers.ttl[https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesEU2022withMembers (in RDF Turtle)], which is an instance of dcat:DatasetSeries using dcat:seriesMembers referring to the abovementioned three instances of dcat:Dataset?
.. Given the fact that `Agent4` has no mandate neither to update the abovementioned three instances of dcat:Dataset nor to enforce the other agents to do so, those instances of dcat:Dataset will remain as they are. Without updating those instances of dcat:Dataset, is this implementation compliant with the current version of https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#inverse-properties[W3C/DCAT3 &#x29C9;, window="_blank", role="ext-link"] (when it uses only the inverse property dcat:seriesMember without at the same using the main property dcat:inSeries)?
. or dereferenced to https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesEU2022withoutMembers.ttl[https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesEU2022withoutMembers (in RDF Turtle)], which is an instance of dcat:DatasetSeries _without_ using dcat:seriesMembers?
.. Neither this instance of dcat:DatasetSeries nor the three instances of dcat:Dataset say anything at all about the memberships of this dataset series, how can our (re)users know which datasets are in this dataset series?
