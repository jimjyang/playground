Let's play with dcat:DatasetSeries! 

We have the following three instances of dcat:Dataset, maintained by three different Agents: 

* https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesCZ2022[]: an instance of dcat:Dataset, maintained ny Agent1,
* https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesNL2022[]: an instance of dcat:Dataset, maintained by Agent2, 
* https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesNO2022[]: an instance of dcat:Dataset, maintained by Agent3.

We have the following file to be harvested into a certain data portal, maintained by Agent4 who wants to create a dataset series using the abovementioned open datasets: 

* https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/source-for-harvesting[]

Question: After the harvesting, should the instance of dcat:DatasetSeries be

. https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesEU2022withMembers[]: an instance of dcat:DatasetSeries using dcat:seriesMembers referring to the abovementioned three instances of dcat:Dataset
.. Note: Agent4 has no mandate to update the abovementioned three instances of dcat:Dataset, and those instances of dcat:Dataset will remain as they are. Without updating those instances of dcat:Dataset, is the implementation compliant to w3C/DCAT (since it uses only dcat:seriesMember without at the same using dcat:inSeries)?  
. https://jimjyang.github.io/playground/dataset-series/beesEU2022withoutMembers[]: an instance of dcat:DatasetSeries _without_ using dcat:seriesMembers. 
.. In this case, how to know which datasets are in this dataset series?
